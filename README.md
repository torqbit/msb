# 🛠️ My Site Builder (MSB)

```

## ✨ What You Can Customize:
Name, bio, contact info
Projects section – add links, descriptions, and tech stacks

---

## ✨ How can you Update Your Portfolio Information

Inside the `site.config.mjs` file, you can update:
- **Personal Information**: Name, bio, contact details.
- **Social Links**: Add your LinkedIn, GitHub, and other profiles.
- **Talks link from Youtube.

### Using Git Environment Variables

To fetch your repositories for the **Projects Section**, you'll need to set up your Git environment:

1. **Generate a Git Token**: Go to GitHub settings, create a Personal Access Token (PAT) for accessing your repositories.
2. **Set Up the Git Token**: Add the token to your `.env` file or Git environment using:

    ```bash
    GIT_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
    ```

3. **Link GitHub Repositories**: Inside `index.tsx`, use the `GIT_TOKEN` to fetch all your repositories with a script, like this:

    ```javascript
    const fetchRepositories = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/users/your-username/repos', {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `token ${process.env.GIT_TOKEN}`
        }
      });
      const repos = await response.json();
      return repos;
    };
    ```

This will allow your portfolio to dynamically display all repositories linked to your GitHub account.

🧠 Why I Made This
I created MSB to make it easier for developers (especially beginners) to build their personal sites without starting from scratch. It's clean, editable, and a great starting point for anyone wanting a digital presence.

📦 Deployment
Once you're happy with your portfolio, you can deploy it to the web using services like:

GitHub Pages: Host your portfolio directly from your GitHub repository.
Vercel: Deploy with automatic deployment on each push.
Netlify: Easily deploy and configure your portfolio with Netlify.
